Create, find, filter, and mark your todos as done inside my brand new app with a geek-oriented design.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Description
The Todo App allows you to create, filter, find, and delete tasks directly in your browser. The app is fully adaptive for mobile devices and tablets and is also cross-browser compatible. The tasks are saved to `localStorage`, so they persist even after you refresh or close the page.

## Features
- **Create Todo**: Add new todos using the "Create" button.
- **Filter Todos**: Click on 'All todos' or 'Important todos' button to filter your tasks.
- **Delete Todo**: Click the delete icon on a todo to remove it.
- **Mark as Important**: Click the star icon on a todo to mark it as important.
- **Mark as Done**: Click the checkmark icon on a todo to mark it as done.
- **Persistent Storage**: Todos are saved in `localStorage` and are loaded when you revisit the app.

## Usage
